# population_simulation
A program that simulates the growth of a population of microorganisms. These microorganisms are sensitive to their environment and react to it by adjusting the probability of cell division, i.e. reproduction. The simulated microorganisms will specifically take into account the concentration of nitrogen (N2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) in their surroundings.
